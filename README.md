# Search query parser

A simple parser for advanced search query syntax.

It parses a string like 
```
from:hi@retrace.io,foo@gmail.com to:me subject:vacations date:1/10/2013-15/04/2014 photos
```

To return an object like this

```javascript
{
  from: ['hi@retrace.io', 'foo@gmail.com'],
  to: 'me',
  subject: 'vacations',
  date: {
    from: '1/10/2013',
    to: '15/04/2014'
    },
  text: 'photos'
}
```

## Installation

```shell
$ npm install search-query-parser
```

## Usage

```javascript
var searchQuery = require('search-query-parser');

var query = 'from:hi@retrace.io,foo@gmail.com to:me subject:vacations date:1/10/2013-15/04/2014 photos';
var options = {keywords: ['from', 'to', 'subject'], ranges: ['date']}

var searchQueryObj = searchQuery.parse(query, options);

// searchQueryObj.from is now ['hi@retrace.io', 'foo@gmail.com']
// searchQueryObj.top is now 'me'
// searchQueryObj.date is now {from: '1/10/2013', to: '15/04/2014'}
// searchQueryObj.text is now 'photos'
```

You can configure what keywords and ranges the parser should accept with the options argument.
It accepts 2 values:
 * `keywords`, that can be separated by commas (,)
 * `ranges`, that can be separated by a hyphen (-)
Both values take an array of strings, as in the example just above.

## Testing

The 15 tests are written using the BDD testing framework should.js. Run `npm install --dev` to install it. Ensure you also have Mocha installed (`node install -g mocha`).

Run tests with  `mocha -R spec`.
